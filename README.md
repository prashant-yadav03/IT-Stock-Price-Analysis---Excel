# üìä Stock Price Analysis of IT Companies (2022‚Äì2023)

Welcome to the Excel-based data analysis project where I explored the performance of major IT companies over a two-year period. This project was done as a case study simulating a real-world business scenario in a financial services firm and showcases my Excel data handling, visualization, and analytical skills.

## üß∞ Project Activities

### üñãÔ∏è Part 1: Data Cleaning & Formatting

- Frozen top row for better navigation.
- Applied proper number formatting (e.g., two decimals for price, commas for large numbers).
- Uniform date format (`dd-mm-yyyy`) and auto-fit column widths.
- Bold & center-aligned headers.
- Conditional formatting:
  - Green if `Close Price > $1000`, red if `< $500`.
  - Market Cap bands: Green (> $10B), Yellow ($5B‚Äì10B), Red (< $5B).
- Font standardization (Calibri 11pt) and cell borders added.
- Light shading for key columns like `Close Price`, `PE Ratio`, and `Dividend Yield`.
- Sheet renamed to **Stock Prices IT**.

### üìà Part 2: Analysis Using Formulas & Logic

- **Volatility Analysis**:
  - Highlighted stocks with high daily volatility (`High - Low > $100`).

- **Insights via Conditional Formatting**:
  - Highlighted:
    - `Dividend Yield > 4%`
    - `PE Ratio < 20`
    - `Beta > 1.5` (high volatility)
    - Negative `Daily Price Change`

  - `COUNTIF`: Trading days with volume > 10M
  - `AVERAGEIF`: Average close price per company
  - `MAX`, `MIN`: Highest/lowest beta and close prices
  - `SUMIF`: Total revenue per company
  - `COUNTIFS`: Number of companies per industry and trading days in specific price ranges
